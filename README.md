# Land Use Change Detection

## Overview of Work Completed

The project task was to develop an algorithm using AWS services, Spark interface, and Python to analyze satellite images over the years to identify changes in land use. The group was divided into 2-3 member teams to manage different stages of the project. Ultimately, we developed an algorithm to detect changes in Landsat 8 satellite images using techniques such as threshold segmentation, heatmaps and more. AWS and Spark were utilized to handle large amounts of data.

Technology Stack:

- AWS EMR and S3
- PySpark
- Python
  - OpenCV
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib
